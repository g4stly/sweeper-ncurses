* use the vim keys to move (hjkl)
	k = up
	l = right 
	j = down
	h = left

* use the d and f keys to dig up and flag spaces respectively

* the m key can be used to flag spaces that are still hidden
	when using the m key on a space that has been uncovered,
	in the event that that space is a number, and it has the same
	number of flags surrounding it, it will auto uncover the remaining
	hidden spaces. 
	
	with this, it is possible to play the entire game with 
	the movement keys and the m key beyond the initial dig up.
